Assistant Professor

Electrical and Computer Engineering

University of California San Diego

I obtained my PhD from the Machine Learning Department, School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University.  My research  interests include sample-efficient learning (e.g., meta learning, domain adaptation, neural symbolic reasoning, etc.), ML for healthcare, deep learning for natural language processing and computer vision, deep generative models, large-scale distributed learning.
