Assistant Professor, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering

Affiliated Faculty, AI Group in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering

University of California San Diego


I obtained my PhD from the Machine Learning Department, School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University.  My research  interests mainly lie in [machine learning inspired by humans' learning skills](https://openreview.net/attachment?id=e5qDTqs1MS&name=pdf) (especially classroom learning skills), such as [learning by self explanation](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/5e84e4413268b713f0d4a1b23a9dae57-Abstract-Conference.html), [small-group learning](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Xie_Performance-Aware_Mutual_Knowledge_Distillation_for_Improving_Neural_Architecture_Search_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf), [learning by teaching](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Tl8OmiibP99), etc., and their applications in **Large Language Models**, **Foundation Models**, and **Healthcare**. [Here](skillearn-outcome-3.pdf) is a summary of research outcome.
