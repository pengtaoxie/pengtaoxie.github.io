I obtained my PhD from the Machine Learning Department, School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University.  My research  interests mainly lie in [machine learning inspired by humans' learning skills](https://openreview.net/attachment?id=e5qDTqs1MS&name=pdf) (especially classroom learning skills), such as [learning by self explanation](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/5e84e4413268b713f0d4a1b23a9dae57-Abstract-Conference.html), [small-group learning](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Xie_Performance-Aware_Mutual_Knowledge_Distillation_for_Improving_Neural_Architecture_Search_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf), [learning by teaching](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Tl8OmiibP99), etc., and their applications in **Large Language Models**, **Foundation Models**, **Healthcare**, and **Biomedicine**. [Here](research-summary.pdf) is a summary of research outcome. Some highlights: (1) Our [DreamPRM-1.5](https://github.com/coder-qicao/DreamPRM-1.5) and [DreamPRM-1.0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20241) methods achieve first place on the [MMMU](https://mmmu-benchmark.github.io/#leaderboard) and [MathVista](https://mathvista.github.io/) leaderboards for multi-modal reasoning, surpassing GPT-5 and Gemini Pro 2.5; (2) our [GenSeg](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-61754-6) method is selected as [Nature Communications Editors’ Highlights](https://www.nature.com/collections/aahajfhafc) (“the 50 best papers recently published”); and (3) our [Betty](https://openreview.net/forum?id=LV_MeMS38Q9) framework was recognized as a Notable-Top-5% paper at ICLR 2023. I received an NSF Career Award in 2024 and an NIH MIRA Award in 2025.
